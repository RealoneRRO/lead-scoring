# Classification  Model (Lead Scoring)
The lead scoring model focused on using logistic regression to predict cate
## The Project's Aim and Objectives
To develop and train a logistic regression model that accurately classifies data points into distinct categories by modeling the probability of converting prospects to customers based on input features.

### Understand the Data and Problem Domain
* Explore the dataset to identify the target variable and the features influencing it.
* Determine whether the classification task is binary (e.g., spam/not spam) or multiclass (e.g., classifying digits from 0 to 9).

### Preprocessing and Exploration of the Data
* Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale features as needed.
* Split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate generalization.

### Implement Logistic Regression
* Define the logistic (sigmoid) function.
* Set up the cost function (binary cross-entropy) and optimization method (e.g., gradient descent).

### Train and Optimize the Model
* Fit the model using training data.
* Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate and regularization strength.
* Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to assess performance.

### Performance Evaluation and Model Interpretations
* Analyze the confusion matrix and performance metrics on the validation and test sets.
* Interpret model coefficients to understand the influence of each feature.
* Visualize decision boundaries if possible.
